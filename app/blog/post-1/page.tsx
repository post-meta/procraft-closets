          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-8">Essential Closet Organization Tips for Seattle Living</h2>
          
          {/* Tip 1 */}
          <div className="mb-10 p-6 border-l-4 border-blue-500 bg-gray-50">
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">1. Create Dedicated Rain Gear Storage</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Seattle's 150+ rainy days per year mean rain gear is essential, but wet items can create humidity and odor 
              issues in your closet. Designate a specific area near your entrance or in your closet for rain jackets, 
              umbrellas, and wet shoes.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
              <li>Install hooks or a rod specifically for damp raincoats to air dry</li>
              <li>Use a waterproof mat or tray for wet shoes and boots</li>
              <li>Consider a small fan or ventilation system to prevent moisture buildup</li>
              <li>Keep rain gear easily accessible near entryways</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          {/* Tip 2 */}
          <div className="mb-10 p-6 border-l-4 border-green-500 bg-gray-50">
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">2. Maximize Vertical Space in Small Closets</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Seattle's urban housing often means smaller closets, especially in condos and older homes. Making the most 
              of vertical space is crucial for effective organization.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
              <li>Install double-hang rods to create two levels of hanging space</li>
              <li>Use shelf dividers to create more organized storage sections</li>
              <li>Add over-door organizers for shoes, accessories, or cleaning supplies</li>
              <li>Consider pull-down closet rods for high spaces</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          {/* Tip 3 */}
          <div className="mb-10 p-6 border-l-4 border-purple-500 bg-gray-50">
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">3. Implement Seasonal Rotation Systems</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Seattle's mild but distinct seasons require strategic clothing rotation. Summer hiking gear and winter rain 
              boots shouldn't compete for prime closet real estate year-round.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
              <li>Store out-of-season items in upper shelves or under-bed storage</li>
              <li>Use vacuum-sealed bags for bulky winter items</li>
              <li>Label storage containers clearly for easy identification</li>
              <li>Keep transitional pieces like light jackets accessible year-round</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          {/* Tip 4 */}
          <div className="mb-10 p-6 border-l-4 border-red-500 bg-gray-50">
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">4. Organize by Lifestyle Zones</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Seattle professionals often balance office work with outdoor activities. Create specific zones in your 
              closet for different aspects of your lifestyle.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
              <li>Professional zone: Business attire, dress shoes, accessories</li>
              <li>Casual zone: Everyday wear, comfortable shoes</li>
              <li>Active zone: Workout clothes, hiking gear, running shoes</li>
              <li>Special occasion zone: Formal wear, evening accessories</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          {/* Tip 5 */}
          <div className="mb-10 p-6 border-l-4 border-yellow-500 bg-gray-50">
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">5. Invest in Moisture Control Solutions</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Seattle's humidity can cause mildew, musty odors, and fabric damage. Proper moisture control protects 
              your clothing investment and maintains a fresh closet environment.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
              <li>Use moisture absorbers or dehumidifiers in closed spaces</li>
              <li>Ensure proper ventilation with fans or vents</li>
              <li>Choose breathable storage materials over plastic when possible</li>
              <li>Cedar blocks or lavender sachets provide natural moisture and pest control</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          {/* Tip 6 */}
          <div className="mb-10 p-6 border-l-4 border-indigo-500 bg-gray-50">
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">6. Optimize Lighting for Cloudy Days</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Seattle's frequent overcast skies mean natural light is limited. Good closet lighting is essential for 
              coordinating outfits and finding items quickly.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
              <li>Install LED strip lights under shelves and along hanging rods</li>
              <li>Add motion-sensor lights for hands-free illumination</li>
              <li>Use warm white bulbs (3000K) to better judge clothing colors</li>
              <li>Consider battery-operated lights for renters or quick solutions</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          {/* Tip 7 */}
          <div className="mb-10 p-6 border-l-4 border-pink-500 bg-gray-50">
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">7. Create Efficient Shoe Storage Systems</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              From rain boots to hiking shoes to professional heels, Seattle residents need diverse footwear. 
              Organize shoes by frequency of use and weather appropriateness.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
              <li>Use shoe racks or cubbies to keep pairs together and visible</li>
              <li>Store frequently used shoes at eye level or easy-reach areas</li>
              <li>Keep muddy or wet shoes in a separate, ventilated area</li>
              <li>Use clear shoe boxes for special occasion or seasonal footwear</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          {/* Tip 8 */}
          <div className="mb-10 p-6 border-l-4 border-teal-500 bg-gray-50">
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">8. Utilize Multi-Functional Storage Accessories</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              In smaller Seattle homes, every closet component should work harder. Choose accessories that serve 
              multiple purposes and maximize your available space.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
              <li>Drawer organizers that adjust to different compartment sizes</li>
              <li>Hanging organizers with both shelves and pockets</li>
              <li>Ottoman storage benches that provide seating and hidden storage</li>
              <li>Hooks that fold flat when not in use</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          {/* Tip 9 */}
          <div className="mb-10 p-6 border-l-4 border-orange-500 bg-gray-50">
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">9. Maintain Regular Decluttering Schedules</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Seattle's active lifestyle and fashion-conscious culture can lead to clothing accumulation. Regular 
              decluttering keeps your closet functional and your donations helping the community.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
              <li>Schedule quarterly reviews of your closet contents</li>
              <li>Follow the one-in-one-out rule for new purchases</li>
              <li>Donate items to local Seattle charities like Goodwill or Union Gospel Mission</li>
              <li>Keep a donation bag accessible for items you discover you no longer wear</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">10. Design for Your Daily Routine</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Your closet should support your specific daily routine, whether you're commuting to South Lake Union 
              or working from your home office in Fremont.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
              <li>Place most-used items at eye level and within easy reach</li>
              <li>Group outfit components together for quick morning decisions</li>
              <li>Create a staging area for next-day outfits</li>
              <li>Keep a full-length mirror nearby for outfit checking</li>
