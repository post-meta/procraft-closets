            1. Smart Closet Technology Integration
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The most significant closet trend of 2025 is the integration of smart technology. Seattle homeowners 
            are embracing automated lighting systems that adjust based on time of day, motion-sensor LED strips 
            that illuminate specific sections, and even AI-powered wardrobe management apps that suggest outfits 
            based on weather patterns and calendar events.

            2. Sustainable and Eco-Friendly Materials
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Reflecting Seattle's commitment to environmental consciousness, 2025 closet designs prioritize 
            sustainable materials. Reclaimed wood, bamboo panels, and low-VOC finishes are becoming standard 
            choices for environmentally aware homeowners. These materials not only reduce environmental impact 
            but also create unique, character-rich storage spaces.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            ProCraft Closets has seen a 40% increase in requests for FSC-certified wood and recycled metal 
            components, demonstrating how sustainability has moved from trend to expectation in luxury closet design.

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Contradicting the minimalist movement, 2025 brings a maximalist approach to closet storage. 
            Seattle homeowners want space for everything – from extensive shoe collections to seasonal sports 
            equipment. This trend emphasizes creative storage solutions that accommodate diverse lifestyles 
            without compromising organization or accessibility.

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Adaptability is key in 2025 closet design. Modular systems allow homeowners to reconfigure their 
            storage as their needs evolve. This trend is particularly popular among Seattle's young professionals
